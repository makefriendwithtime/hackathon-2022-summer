###Current pain points
    Official staking is not flexible and not liquid, and could not generate extra yields for delegators
    Collators should have a large reserve to keep themselves in the active set  low capital efficiency
    Technically capable, non-whale community contributors are impossible to be a collator.

###Project introduction
    Establish a highly sticky DAO community, provide continuous and efficient collateral for pos public chain nodes, and provide community users with more pledge income and higher liquidity.
    Stafi DAO is a highly autonomous multi-chain community. Community users are divided into: pledge users, lease users and technical service providers.
    Pledge function: establish a swap trading pool of stkToken to solve the problem of depletion of liquidity for DAO Pool redemption; pledge users provide liquid collateral for DAO Pool, and users pledge native Token to obtain stkToken, a certificate for redeeming the pledge; community users Initiate proposals for governance and automatically change Pool operating parameters to achieve decentralized community autonomy;
    Pledge user income: Hold stkToken to get airdrop reward retToken (used for leasing pledge), and get node pledge reward generated by leasing;
    Leasing function: establish a swap transaction pool of retToken to solve the problem of demand circulation;
    The lease user obtains retToken from the transaction pool, sets the lease time, burns the retToken and mortgages part of the retToken to lease the pledge from the DAO Pool and pledge it to the Pos node;
    Leasing user income: Collectors (validators) receive node technology fees for node pledge rewards, and delegators receive node pledge rewards;
    The technical service provider provides technical support and upgrade services for the DAO community;
    Technical service provider's income: get technical service fees.
    The positioning of DAO is clear and the users are clear. With the healthy operation of the Pool, it will definitely bring better governance, more income and higher liquidity to the three-party users in the community.
    Moonbeam related ecology used in the project:
    Use zenlink dex as a liquidity trading pool for stkToken and retToken;
    Use subquery as a data layer for query governance, voting, airdrops and rewards.
    There are 6 team members, two are graduate students, and the rest are undergraduate graduates! The core members of the team have 1-3 years of experience in smart contract development, all of them have transformed from the traditional Internet to the blockchain direction, and have deep programming accumulation! At present, an Ethereum-based wallet system has been developed for the nft minting transaction system in intellectual property,
    DAPP such as decentralized voting system.

###Technical Description
    infrastructure and tools
    Web layer: vue + web3js
    Contract layer: truffle + solidity
    Intermediate data layer: subquery
    Automation layer: java + web3j
    Ecological layer: zenlink
    System Design Notes
    web3pc, h5, vue render data, and the web uses js to sign contracts with the chain;
    The contract layer is developed based on EV, adopts multi-intelligence design, and deploys truffle tests;
    The data layer adopts the intermediate query of the data on the chain, and the query of the historical data is realized
    The automation layer uses java+web3j to process the automatic execution function of the contract on the chain;
    The ecological layer uses zenlink to establish a transaction pool and relies on polkadot to achieve multi-chain development.

**Blockchain**

  - [ ] Governance (`contract Governance、subquery`)
  - [ ] Staking Pool (`contract Pool`)
  - [ ] Token lease (`contract Faucet`)
  - [ ] Airdrop reward (`contract Airdrop、subquery`)
  - [ ] Staking reward (`contract Reward、subquery`)

**client**

- web
  - [ ] Instructions for use
  - [ ] Governance page（Proposal, Vote）
  - [ ] Token pledge page（Pledge Details, Pledge, Redemption）
  - [ ] Token lease page（Collector, Delegator）
  - [ ] reward page（Airdrop reward、Staking reward）

- auxiliary
  - [ ] automated execution（Airdrop rewards, pledge distribution, lease recovery）
  - [ ] data index（Governance Vote, Airdrop reward, Staking reward）
